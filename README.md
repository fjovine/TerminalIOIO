# TerminalIOIO
Demo package under AndroidStudio to use the IOIO board as an asynchronous terminal.

Summary
-------
The IOIO board [https://github.com/ytai/ioio](https://github.com/ytai/ioio) is general purpose USB interface 
board featuring a rich set of features and implemented by means of a powerful blend of software/firmware/hardware 
completely under OpenSource licence.

There are many possible uses of this board (please refer to the original documentation by **Ytai Ben-Tsvi**, the author 
of this project) but most of the examples are projects to be loaded and used under Ecplipse.

This project is an android app that uses the UART embedded in a IOIO board to implement a simple terminal app that can 
send and receive messages on a serial line.

Usage of the app
